A cross-platform rich text editor intended for use in Matrix clients including
the Element clients.

Works on Web, Android and iOS using a cross-platform core written in Rust,
and platform-specific wrappers.

__Important note:__ This project is still in an early stage. Minor versions could bring 
breaking API changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Live demo

Try it out at
[element-hq.github.io/matrix-rich-text-editor](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-rich-text-editor/).

## Building the code

Get the prerequisites for each platform by reading the READMEs for them:

* WASM/JavaScript:
  [bindings/wysiwyg-wasm/README.md](bindings/wysiwyg-wasm/README.md)

* Android/Kotlin or iOS/Swift:
  [bindings/wysiwyg-ffi/README.md](bindings/wysiwyg-ffi/README.md)

Now, to build all the bindings, try:

```bash
make
```

To build for a single platform, or to learn more, see the individual README
files above.

## Release the code

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

## More info

For more detailed explanations and examples of platform-specific code to use
Rust bindings like those generated here, see
